# FUNCIONAL PROGRAMMING

![.NET Core](https://github.com/JeanLLopes/Applying-Functional-Principles/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg?branch=master)

O que programação funcional ?
Imutabilidade ?

## MATHEMETICAL FUNCIONS
> Honest
>> Definethe input and outputs in method

<br>

> Referentially transparent
>> not affect the global state of application
   
<br>

## IMUTABILITY

Define with a object can`t  change during your life cicle, the only way to set new informationis creating a new instance.

This rule generate methods more honest

Another good reasson is thread safe, you not have a others threads in concurrency with this real informa~tions about your classe instance
>> not affect the global state of application

<br>

## Exceptions

- Prefer return values over exceptions
- When find a fail return immediately
- Return a "result" clas with result of method
- The result of a validation needs inform more details about this exception



<br>

## Avoidign Primitive Obsession

- Create a especific types to declare with more simples what you send
- Define the rules in only one way
- don't duplicate code (DRY)
