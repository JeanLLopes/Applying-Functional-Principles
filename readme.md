Funcional programming is, programming with mathematic programing

## MATHEMETICAL FUNCIONS
> Honest
>> Definethe input and outputs in method

<br>

> Referentially transparent
>> not affect the global state of application
   
<br>

## IMUTABILITY

Define with a object can`t  change during your life cicle, the only way to set new informationis creating a new instance.

This rule generate methods more honest

Another good reasson is thread safe, you not have a others threads in concurrency with this real informa~tions about your classe instance
